        <p>Hello, my name is Laura Breslin and I'm a returning student to college. I originally graduated with a BS in
            Multimedia and Graphic Design in 2009 from a small New England college and wish to update my skills and
            technically make a career change. I have previous experience working as a freelance graphic designer (not
            really doing any web stuff, just traditional production type work with file assets) and I as a federal
            contractor for the U.S. Department of Statesâ€™ Visa and Passport Services for 4 years performing
            administrative
            work.</p>
        <section id="secondParagraph">
            <p>I'm taking a big leap and making a career change in my 30s. When I completed my
                first degree, I couldn't help but feel I pursued the wrong major. I've always loved computers and the
                web,and want to be a front end developer or visual web designer. I am a lifelong learner and believe in
                thpursuit of new knowledge.</p>
